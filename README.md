# Genbu

__!This Project is currently in alpha!__

Genbu is a web-based collaborative whiteboard tool that has similarities to products like OneNote or Xournal++. By using technologies like CRDT's, WebRTC and Supabase Realtime, collaboration and synchronization is prioritized.

For Genbu, data security is a top priority. Profiles are private, WebRTC rooms are encrypted, and because the entire project is and always will be open source, anyone can host it themselves.
